HTML Semantic Containers Exercise
Take yesterday's solution from HTML Introduction Exercise and add some more semantic structure:

Create a header section at the top
Add an img of the app-academy logo within the header section
Add a nav element within the header, after the logo
Cut and paste your unordered list of anchor links into the nav section
Add an aside element
Cut and paste all of the ingredients elements into the aside
Put the recipe image inside of a figure element
Add a figcaption element below the figure
Cut the link to wikipedia from your description paragraph and paste it into the figcaption element
Add a section element to contain the figure, description and instruction elements
Add a footer element at the bottom
Add a p element in the footer with some text/link about where the recipe originated from
After coding your recipe page, compare your html to this example.
